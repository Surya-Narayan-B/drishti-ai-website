## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Intelligent Fatigue Score:** Instead of simple alerts, DrishtiAI calculates a unified fatigue score based on a pattern of behaviors, including long blinks, head nods, and yawns, for more accurate drowsiness detection.
* **Advanced Gaze & Head Pose Tracking:** A robust 2.5D head pose model accurately tracks your gaze direction and distinguishes between drowsy head nods and simple posture changes like leaning back.
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** A live dashboard visualizes your blink rate (BPM), active time, and fatigue score, giving you immediate feedback on your screen habits.
* **Conversational AI Assistant:** Powered by Google Gemini, the AI assistant remembers your conversation and can provide wellness tips, explain your stats, or answer general questions.
* **Personalized Calibration:** A one-time calibration process tunes the detection parameters to your unique facial structure and environment, ensuring high accuracy.
* **Smart Alerts & Reminders:** The application provides notifications for eye strain (staring), low blink rates, and scheduled breaks based on the 20-20-20 rule.
